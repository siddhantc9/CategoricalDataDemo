rattle (2.6.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace .path.package with path.package as requested by Ripley. The
    hidden version will disappear soon and the new version has been
    available since 2.13.0.

  * Update boost help to note that it is available only for binary
    classification.

  * Default stemming for textmining of a corpus is no active if the
    Snowball package is available.

  * For Advanced Graphics introduce a dendrogram plot using ggplot2.

  * Various text mining improvements. Bug fix in checking if data needs
    reloading.  Support checking if corpus needs reloading.  Add extra
    cursor and status bar messages.  For corpus, set default folder to be
    getwd().  Check for mismatch between number of docs in corpus and the
    number of targets in .targets.csv. For the Corpus file dialog, do not
    offer folder creation.

  * Remove macosx special rattle.ui. The ubuntu specific text no longer
    appears in the saved ui file.

  * Internally: Move rattleGUI to crv from crs. The crs is saved as the
    state, and this was confusing the GUI on a project restore.  Had to
    ensure we restored rattleGUI with the current rattleGUI - this fixes
    loadProject bug.  Also, in Load project, filter on .RData not .Rdata.

  * Add newdata= to call to predict, in line with the standard approach by
    party (reference Torston). Remove the OOB= for predict for
    cforest. With a new dataset OOB makes no sense. It was in there
    because newdata= was not being used and positionally having issues.

  * Update fancy rpart plot to reduce colour intensity for printing and a
    nicer tree structure. Add all class probs to fancy tree.

  * Define paste0 if it is not defined. It was introduced in 2.15.0 but is
    too early to assume the world is with us.

  * Replace siatclust with weightedKmeans.

  * Bug fix in OOB plot when impute is off - need to omit missing values.
    Update message regarding random forest and na.omit() removing all
    rows, noting the option to use na.roughfix().

  * Fix bug identified by Brian Feeny 121209 - score a RF test dataset
    without a target variable tries to add one in all NA but fails if it
    is the last variable.

  * Experimentally add Deducer's data.viewer to View data.  Ensure we ask
    user if when using Plot Builder it is okay to create a dataset in
    their work space. Hopefully keeps us in line, if not strictly in
    copmliance, with CRAN policy.

  * Remove SVG support - RSvgDevice is no longer available.

rattle (2.6.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Review all of the code and remove two instances of using copyrighted
    code without attribution. One was a copy or print.rpart, where rattle
    added a translation wrapper to the text message. Another was code
    copied from the Internet from David Hand - use the Hmeasure package
    now. Note in drawTreeNode() reference to the original author and lack
    of copyright. Note author in Authors@R. ggcorplot is now available
    from Deducer. Remove it from Rattle. Replace Hand measure with
    HMeasure from hmeasure. Add Mark Vere Culp as aux author. Remove
    commented out code. Remove lss and cranSearch - not really part of
    Rattle.

  * Update to new style Authors@R.

  * Migrate to a cleaner structure for managing the source package locally
    at togaware.

  * Bug fix fancy rpart plot to handle regression as suggested by Yana
    Kane-Esrig.

rattle (2.6.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix for Mac OS/X on 2.14.0 with a call to set.cursor failing
    because the textviews do not yet exist. Problem is that the
    addFromFile for the GUI is generating a Warning that seems to now stop
    the file being loaded. Removing the particular XML elemnts causing the
    warning (one ubuntu_local and 4 GtkTreeSelections) "fixes" the
    problem.

  * Add setupDataset and whichNumeric to support encapsulation of data
    mining objects.

  * Add a fancyRpartPlot so my fancy rpart tree is available outside of
    the rattle GUI.

  * Correct the textview information relating to confusion matrices.

  * Add doRiskChart to simplify using the risk charts.

rattle (2.6.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure ggplot2 loaded before plot ctree.

  * Handle probability predictions for ctree and cforest in evaluation.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Tue, 26 Jul 2011 22:03:47 +1000

rattle (2.6.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for the entropy weighted k-means subspace clustering
    algorithm from the ewkm package.

  * Ensure rattle can load with only the base package installed (so
    install.packages is prefixed with utils:::).

  * Migrate from using installed.pacakges() since it can be very slow on
    MS/Windows.

  * Add an experimental dataset option to the command line call to rattle.

  * Allow a bygroup to be used for any numeric transform.

  * Add a plot for association rules.

  * Display a ggplot2 scatterplot if advanced plots is enabled.

  * rattle:::executeExplorePlot made more friendly for calling from
    outside of Rattle.

  * Tidy up the rattleInfo manual page.

  * Master Makefile should respond with help if no target specified.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Mon, 18 Jul 2011 06:53:47 +1000

rattle (2.6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Settings/Tooltips should be shown as TRUE.

  * Add Settings/GGPlot2 to enable enhanced graphics (generally using
    ggplot2) where they have been implemented.

  * Implement a ggplot2 pairs plot (scatterplot) as the plot to use when
    ggplot2 is enabled and under Explore/Distriubtions no variables are
    chosen to be displayed. Uses ggcorplot from Deducer.

  * Implement use of rpart.plot's prp() when ggplot2 is enabled.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 09 Apr 2011 22:16:29 +1000

rattle (2.6.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add rattleReport() - report on current state of rattle modelling.

  * Restore the ByGroup option for now until it can be coded for the about
    transforms.

  * Deal with UTF-8 encoding of Japanese filenames in data and evaluate,
    using iconv.

  * Be sure to include http:// in web links, though on MS/Windows still
    not working: Could Not Show Link... No application is registered as
    handling this file

  * On loading a dataset, convert any character variables to be
    factors. Rattle does not handle character variables, so the
    translation seems appropriate.

  * Association rules status bar was refering to decision
    trees. Fixed. (Pointed out by Xiaobo Gu)

  * Fix an introduced bug in handling of categorics in numeric transforms.

  * Fix a bug where imputation for a categoric with class "ordered" and
    "factor" was treating it as a numeric (because "ordered" is not
    "factor").

  * Some Help menu items under Test were not loading the required package
    and thus were not displaying the help.

  * Only do crosstabs when we have categoric variables.

  * Updated translations.

rattle (2.6.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Confusion matrices transposed to conform to what most people exect:
    Actual is on left and Predicted is on top. Retain the name as Error
    Matrix in Rattle for now.

  * Use different pch for a dotchart.

  * Include the install.packages(rattleInfo()) trick in the output of
    rattleInfo().

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 19 Feb 2011 06:26:09 +1100

rattle (2.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * weather.arff Date field should have 'date' data type.

  * The rug plot of histograms is no longer coloured. For large datasets,
    there is much overplotting and so it can in fact be quite misleading.

  * Box plots now use varwidth=TRUE to indicate the distribution of the
    target variable.

  * Bug fix: exportHClustTab should not have a file argument.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sun, 13 Feb 2011 21:42:11 +1100

rattle (2.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename rattle.info() to rattleInfo(), modelled on sessionInfo()
    naming. Include available CRAN version of rattle in the output.

  * Ensure connection is closed on pmmltoc export from Rattle.

  * questionDialog needs to not use RGtk2 if RGtk2 is not installed!

  * Emphasise that Rattle is free in loading the rattle package.

  * exportKmeansTab does not require the file argument.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 02 Feb 2011 05:46:28 +1100

rattle (2.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * When exporting a regression model, be sure to use proper slash (i.e.,
    not the Windows slosh) for log tab record of the command.

  * Add rattle.ui to the google code repository.

  * Remove as many literals as possible from the Log tab - so that
    crs$dataset[crs$sample, c(2:10,14,16:20)] becomes
    crs$dataset[crs$sample, c(crs$input, crs$target)], for
    example. Similarly for the set.seed and other data storing variables.

  * Other Log tab cleanup.

  * Fix bug that caused failure on reading an .xls data file.

  * rattle.info() now returns the list of packages that need updating.

  * In exporting a model as C code, if we are Japanese on Windows then
    note that the encoding is shift-jis rather than utf-8 for some reason.

  * Improve infrastructure for the generation of C code from PMML.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 13 Jan 2011 21:50:53 +1100

rattle (2.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Keep track of project names and use as default name to save a project
    to. Suggested by David Cochrane.

  * Add strip.white to the default for reading CSV files. Suggested by
    Robert Muenchen.

  * Bug fix on resetEvaluateTab - Data row was being reset to sensitive
    because model was being toggled.

  * Disconnect Rattle versions from google code revision numbers since the
    revision numbers change each change to the Wiki.

  * Indicator Variables will Ignore the first of the new indicator
    variables. Suggested by Robert Muenchen.

  * Include the Target name in listing of a decision tree as a rule set.

  * On adding to the log when saving a plot make sure carioDevice is
    loaded and the file name path separators are appropriate. Reported by
    Shane Butler 11 Dec 2010.

  * Ensure filename string is UTF-8 when exporting a file, to handle
    Japanese filenames.

  * For nnet, choose a seed so weather generates a non-trivial model.

  * Refer to remapping as recoding in line with commonly used terminology.

  * Default back to showing text on icon for buttons. Seems okay in the
    new version of Gtk.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 11 Dec 2010 13:39:55 +1100

rattle (2.5.47) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a useGtkBuilder argument to rattle(). If NULL, then heuristically
    determine, otherwise go with the specified choice, if possible.

  * Remove RGtk2, colorspace, and pmml as dependencies. Now dynamically
    check and offer to install. This also helps reduce chance of the
    XML/RGtk2 zlib1.dll bug, and also ensure RGtk2 loads before XML to
    avoid that bug.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Mon, 15 Nov 2010 21:50:15 +1100

rattle (2.5.46) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix for fixTranslations.

  * Save weights information in PMML.

  * Cleanup SVM command generator.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 19:08:36 +1100

rattle (2.5.45) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check for GtkBuilder handling of the 'requires' tag, and if not
    handled the don't use GtkBuilder.

  * Bump pmml version through 1.2.25 to 1.2.26.

  * Change default nolan groups for a singularity to 50 rather than 99.

  * PMML bug fix when glm and using weights.

  * Move all variable initialisation from .onLoad to .onAttach. This will
    ensure .RData saved (and therefore old) versions of the variables will
    not overwrite the proper versions in a newer release of Rattle.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 09 Oct 2010 08:16:15 +1100

rattle (2.5.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add an include.libpath to rattle.info() to provide information about
    where the packages are installed.

  * Check for failed startup of rattle GUI using GtkBuider (because the
    Gtk library installed does not recognise 'requires' and suggest a
    workaround).

  * Condiionally turn toolbar Text (in addition to just Icons) on.

  * For loading spreadsheets, make sure RODBC is available and loaded.

  * Ensure 'ordered categoric' are treated as categoric for Explore,
    Distribution.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Tue, 05 Oct 2010 18:08:20 +1100

rattle (2.5.43) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure gtkBuilder is setting the correct translation domain for the
    interface.

  * Add global option for not showing timestamps: crv$show.timestamp.

  * Add optional arg to newProject to not ask about overwriting a
    project. Default is as previously - to ask.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 22 Sep 2010 05:37:53 +1000

rattle (2.5.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update rattle.info() to recursively identify all dependencies, report
    their version number and any updates available from CRAN and generate
    command to update packages that have updates available. See
    ?rattle.info for the options.

  * Fix bug causing R Dataset option of the Evaluate window to always
    revert to the first named dataset.

  * Fix bug in transforms where weights were not being handled in
    refreshing of the Data tab.

  * Fix a bug in box plots when trying to label outliers when there aren't
    any.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sun, 19 Sep 2010 05:01:51 +1000

rattle (2.5.41) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use GtkBuilder for Export dialog.

  * Test use of glade vs GtkBuilder on multiple platforms.

  * Rename rattle.info to rattle.version.

  * Add weight column to data tab.

  * Support weights for nnet, multinom, survival.

  * Add weights information to PMML as a PMML Extension.

  * Ensure GtkFrame is available as a data type whilst waiting for updated
    RGtk2.

  * Bug fix to packageIsAvailable not reruning any result.

  * Replace destroy with withdraw for plot window as the former has
    started crashing R.

  * Improve Log formatting for various model build commands.

  * Be sure to include the car package for Anova for multinom models.

  * Release pmml 1.2.24: Bug fix glm binomial regression - note as
    classification model.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 15 Sep 2010 14:56:09 +1000

rattle (2.5.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conditionalise useGtkBuilder:
    if windows and R before 2.12.0 then libglade 
    if unix and R 2.12.0 then libglade for now (RGtk2 update needed?)
    all else use GtkBuilder

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sun, 22 Aug 2010 12:02:00 +1000

rattle (2.5.39) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conditionally use either libglade2 or GtkBuilder for the
    GUI. libglade2 (a separate library to the Gtk+ library) is deprecated
    and as of R 2.12.0 won't be supported on MS/Windows binary builds. The
    default is now GtkBuilder (built into the Gtk+ library), and support
    for libglade2 within Rattle is deprecated. RGtk2 (2.12.18) still has
    issues in its support of GtkBuilder and is being actively worked on,
    but Rattle is currently working around these.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 21 Aug 2010 07:47:43 +1000

rattle (2.5.38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure pmml.ksvm will at least run - though resulting PMML not
    validated.

  * Bump pmml version to 1.2.23

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Fri, 06 Aug 2010 05:56:11 +1000

rattle (2.5.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * The Predictive tab has gone back to being Model. Not sure which is
    best.

  * cranSearch defaults to r-project rather than unimelb.

  * Migrate from RGtk2DfEdit to its replacement, RGtk2Extras.

  * Revert cairoDevice to being a Suggests rater than Depends.

  * Remove redundant CITATION from root of package, as the real one is in
    inst.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 31 Jul 2010 14:34:50 +1000

rattle (2.5.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Bill Venables' searchCRAN example code.

  * Improve error message when we find duplicate variable names in a
    loaded file, which might result when there is no header line.

  * Add help item for Projects.

  * On Evaluate with supplied file, use the hdr specified on the Data tab.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Mon, 12 Jul 2010 06:43:06 +1000

rattle (2.5.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add utility lss function to list object sizes.

  * Add options text entry for SVM to easily allow other options.

  * Better formatting of the Log tab.

  * Use a set.seed for SVM to ensure same model each time.

  * Add option to random forest to impute missing values rather than
    simply ignoring the observations.

  * On Evalaute with supplied file, use the sep specified on the Data tab,
    thus allowing TXT files.

  * On loading a new dataset for evaluation be sure to add in any missing
    columns, and unify the levels.

  * Improve binning documentation.

  * Make RGtk2, cairoDevice, colorspace all dependencies so we can get
    rattle started and then rattle will prompt to install other packages
    that are mssing when it needs them.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 01 Jul 2010 15:34:50 +1000

rattle (2.5.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * When a package is missing, there is now the option to install it right
    then, and it continues as normal after it gets installed.

  * Change Suggests to Depends so all used pacakges get loaded on loading
    rattle, in an attempt to make it easier to install Rattle. Then the
    r-cran-rattle package on Debian/Ubuntu will have all required
    dependencies and a normal install.packages will get all dependencies
    also, rather than having to use dependencies=c('Depends',
    'Suggests'). Penalty is it takes 20 seconds to do 'library(rattle)' on
    a server and 90 seconds on a netbook - so revert back to not doing
    this.

  * Ensure the new train/validate/test scneario is saved across projects.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 09 Jun 2010 07:04:08 +1000

rattle (2.5.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix rf.cmd.

  * Improve scoring functionality: The dataset can have NA's for target,
    and these can now get scored by rf on Evaluate tab. Loading a CSV file
    to be scored no longer needs to have the target column included
    (previously it needed to be there and have non-NA values). Thanks to
    Chris Snijders.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Mon, 31 May 2010 06:22:54 +1000

rattle (2.5.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependency on car - not actually being used at the moment.

  * For random forest, allow sample size text entry as a single integer or
    a list, as per randomForest.

  * Use na.omit with cforest, as is done with randomForest.

  * For randomForest turn subsampling with replacement off since it is
    more likely to produce biased importance measures, as explained in by
    the cforest papers.

  * Fix bug with multiple "contact support" lines in error popups.

  * When showing the randomForest importance values, sort on the accuracy
    measure rather than the Gini measure, since the Gini is biased in
    favour of categoric variables with many categories.

  * ada boost seed should be 42, like all other seeds.

  * Tidy up some ada output.

  * Bug fix - save project for rf failing (looking for rf_sampsize_entry).

  * Remove text from toolbar by default.

  * Change order of Forest/Boost buttons on Model tab.

  * Add tooltips for all toolbar buttons.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Fri, 28 May 2010 15:47:15 +1000

rattle (2.5.31) stable; urgency=low

  * Add rattle.info() to list information for debugging purposes.

  * Bump pmml to 1.2.22

  * Fixes from wenching.lin@zementis.com: Extension in Header should be
    first element. Coefficients in regression models should not be NA (as
    will be for singularities), but replace with, and so no impact of
    change.

  * Ensure Survival defaults are reset appropriately.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 19 May 2010 09:50:39 +1000

rattle (2.5.30) stable; urgency=low

  * On MS/Windows with Japanese, read.csv needs encoding option set with
    file rather than with read.csv (for UTF-8) but seems okay under other
    scenarios.

  * On MS/Windows with Japanese (UTF-8) the encoding of the variables
    selected for transforming needs to be UTF-8 for much of the process,
    but "unknown" when using Rtxt and sprintf (when substituting the
    variable names) to ensure resulting message is correctly matched for
    encodings.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Wed, 19 May 2010 09:47:12 +1000

rattle (2.5.29) stable; urgency=low

  * Add the translation file.

  * Fix an Encoding/sprintf issue for Japanese on MS/Windows.

  * Allow crv$NOTEBOOK.MODEL.NAME to be overridden by other packages
    (RStat).

  * When dispatch fails be sure to include the Tab label on which it fails.

  * Ensure HClust Options are re-enabled on loading a project.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 24 Apr 2010 07:32:02 +1000

rattle (2.5.28) stable; urgency=low

  * Minor format changes for glm and rf model output.

  * Capture additional survival model error and suggest a solution.

  * Remove spurious additional plot for Survival Residual plot.

  * Update log tab labels to be more generic.

  * Update tooltips to be generic and add survival tooltips.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 22 Apr 2010 06:21:58 +1000

rattle (2.5.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further translation fixes. In particular, use Encoding(...getText())
    <- "UTF-8" to ensure strings from the GUI ate UTF-8, and not unknown.

  * Ensure training dataset rather than sample dataset nomenclature is now
    used.

  * Ensure execute button can only be clicked once while it is processing.

  * Survival plot buttons need to be made sensitive as appropriate.

  * For Japanese on MS/Windows do not use monospace font since this ends
    up vertically cenbtering periods and commas (and all other
    characters). Need a fixed width font that does not do this, but for
    now we put up with variable width font.

  * Revert to using only English for all hidden tab labels.

  * Improved identification of current plot number.

  * Bug fix multiple vars selected for asnumeric and ascategoric
    transforms.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Thu, 22 Apr 2010 06:17:20 +1000

rattle (2.5.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Cross Tab option to Explore tab to generate cross tabulations of
    each categoric variable by the target variable. (Luke Lake)

  * Bug fix - improve how we obtain the plot number from the title,
    particularly in the context of translations.

  * Further translation markup.

  * Clean up the use of dfedit.

  * Minor improvement to spacing in Log tab.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Tue, 30 Mar 2010 21:37:29 +1100

rattle (2.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Start using the RGtk2DfEdit for the View and Edit buttons of the Data
    tab, and the Enter/Score option of the Evaluate tab. RGtk2DfEdit
    provides a spreadhseet like interface to the data. Various data
    editing options are available. Also press = to run an arbitrary R
    command on selected data (e.g. select two columns of data and issue
    the plot command).

  * Add further markup of text for translations.

  * Support specification of the character used for decimal points (to
    suit some European usage).

  * Fix bug in exporting XML - replace & with &amp;

  * Survival plots - split survival chart plot from residuals plots, and
    plot all residuals.

  * Fix logic behind what is greyed out in the Test tab.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Mon, 29 Mar 2010 19:37:25 +1100

rattle (2.5.24) stable; urgency=low

  * Revamp the help text, and put into the Rtxt translation framework.

  * Fix the height of the data name widget (the library option was growing
    the width for some reason).

  * For Evaluate, add Full and Enter as dataset options. Enter will pop up
    an editor with the final row from the dataset, allowing you to add
    rows or modify the supplied row. We supply the row so that we have an
    example to work from. Full uses the whole original dataset.

 -- Graham Williams <Graham.Williams@togaware.com>  Sat, 06 Mar 2010 14:17:12 +1100

rattle (2.5.23) stable; urgency=low

  * Catch "arules" error in converting data to transactions when baskets
    contain repeated items.

  * When data tab is executed, and so crs$rpart is reset to NULL, always
    remove the Draw/Rules button from the Tree option of the Predictive
    tab.

  * Add code to fix translations that are not being loaded when using
    RGtk2 on MS/Windows. All is okay on GNU/Linux, but RGtk2 seems not to
    get the right locale for loaded Glade file. The fix is to traverse the
    GUI and change all labels, on starting up Rattle. RGtk2 authors tried
    to fix but it remains an issue.

  * Ensure rpart is reset on resetting rattle.

  * Rework handling of tab pages because a Japanese translation on
    MS/Windows is having issues with the following call (nd=notebook)
    nb$getTabLabelText(nb$getNthPage(nb$getCurrentPage())) returning what
    looks like Shift-JIS encoding of the string rather than UTF-8, and
    hence not string matching the expected tab label.

  * Fix spelling errors on help menu and ensure help for all topics is
    covered.

  * For nnet, use MaxNWts=10000 (default is 1000) to allow larger nets by
    default, and capture the error message when this is exceeded and
    better explain what to do.

  * Ensure we don't export an empty dataset when choosing export on the
    data tab.

  * Capture arules error message when there are repeated items in one
    basket, and explain this more clearly.

  * For rpart use information as the default split rather than Gini - makes
    little if any difference.

  * Allow showHelpPlus to have an extra/alternative question that is
    displayed.

  * All random seeds should be 42.

  * Reset kmeans tab on loading a project.

  * Add dozen more weather stations to the weatherAUS dataset.

  * Improve the logic for the display of the Report radio buttons on the
    Evaluate tab.

  * Spelling correction to a number of tooltips.

  * Re-enable gettext on MS/Windows, even though RGtk2 2.12.18 has not
    fixed the bindtextdomain problem with glade files and package supplied
    translations.

  * Change the tree plot to us "< =>" and ">= <" to clearly identify which
    branch the "=" results go. Could not figure out how to get expression
    to us a "ge" symbol.

  * Improve formatting of the PvO plots.

  * Use the pairs.panels function from the psych package for the default
    scatterplot on the Explore tab.

  * Model tab renamed as Predictive.

  * Ensure boxplots have same "by ..." in the main title.

  * Update the weather dataset and include many more weather stations in
    the weatherAUS dataset.

  * Rtxt does no translations when running on MS/Windows (for now).
